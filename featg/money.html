<p> <mark>here are two many things that are expensive and cost a lot of money. Some things that come to mind are organic foods, hair care products, and an Oboe. But the one thing that isn't really thought about when discussing expensive things, is being round. I mean,the average globe costs $70, to someone such as myself that's a pretty big chunk of change. And these experts are going to tell me that the entire planet that can afford to be round. In this economy, I don't think so.</mark>T</p>
