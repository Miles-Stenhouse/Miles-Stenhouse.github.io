<p>Before you, sits an image of the Earth. Ya know, seven Continents, Three major oceans, the usual business. However the interesting thing about the Earth is that no matter how you look at this planet, whether it's on a CRT Television from 2000 or the real thing in outer space. No matter way, visually [Through out Eyeballs], the Earth is flat. Our eyeballs have accepted the truth centuries ago, yet there are those out there that hav yet to accept this. It's okay, don't fight your eyes.  </p>
